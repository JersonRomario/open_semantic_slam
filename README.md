# 🌟 Open Semantic SLAM

Welcome to the official repository for **Open Semantic SLAM (open_semantic_slam)** - your gateway to cutting-edge technology in the field of robotics and computer vision! Dive into the future with us as we introduce you to the revolutionary OpenGS-SLAM: Open-Set Dense Semantic SLAM with 3D Gaussian Splatting for Object-Level Scene Understanding, a game-changer in the realm of robotics and AI.

## 🚀 Introduction

Developed for the ICRA2025 conference, Open Semantic SLAM pushes the boundaries of traditional SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques. This repository serves as a hub for all the code, resources, and information you need to understand and implement OpenGS-SLAM in your own projects.

## 📚 Key Features

- **Open-Set Dense Semantic SLAM:** Our approach goes beyond traditional SLAM by incorporating dense semantic information, providing a deeper understanding of the environment.
  
- **3D Gaussian Splatting:** Leveraging advanced techniques like 3D Gaussian splatting elevates the accuracy and robustness of the SLAM system.

- **Object-Level Scene Understanding:** Gain insights into the scene at the object level, enabling more nuanced decision-making and interactions in robotics applications.
